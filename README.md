# Software Engineering Blog Directory

[![Repo Banner](imgs/sweblogs_banner.webp)](https://sweblogs.fyi/)

Welcome to the __Software Engineering Blog Directory__ 🙂! This is a growing list of non-corporate, active software engineering blogs from around the world. Our mission is to help engineers discover new voices, perspectives, and insights in the tech community.

We'd love for you to contribute and help us keep this directory fresh and valuable!

## How to contribute 🚀

Contributing is simple and we encourage everyone to get involved!

1. Fork this repository.
1. Make your changes to the [data.json](https://github.com/rtdev-com/swe-blog-directory/blob/main/data.json) file (where all the blog data is stored).
1. Open a pull request when you're ready, and GitHub Actions will automatically handle the build 🏗 and deployment 🚀.

Don’t worry if you’re new to GitHub; we're happy to help guide you through the process if needed!

### Contribution Guidelines ✍️

To maintain the quality and relevance of the directory, we ask that any new blog submissions meet these simple criteria:

1. Blog Age: The blog should be at least 1 year old.
1. Posting Frequency: At least 1 post per quarter (4 per year).
1. Recency: The latest post should be within the last 3 months.
1. Author Type: Blogs must be written by individuals or small groups—no corporate or heavily commercialized blogs, please!

If you're unsure whether a blog qualifies, feel free to open a discussion, and we'll take a look together!

1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Build the directory: `python build.py`
1. Check the `/output` directory for the generated artifacts.
